# Meet Wise

Meetwise is a web application done in Meteor.js.

The core idea of it is to allow the creation of groups with a destination. Each member of the group,
will specificy their position on the map to allow each of the group member to keep track of where they are.

Currently under construction but available at meetwise.herokuapp.com
